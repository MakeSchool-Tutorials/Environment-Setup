At Make School we use a few digital tools to facilitate coding and collaborating with instructors and other students. Each of these tools you will use EVERYDAY when you are at the product college so it is important that they are loaded on your computer and you are familiar with them before you arrive.

# The Command Line or Terminal

If you are not extremely comfortable with navigating the command line (also called your computer's "terminal"), please complete the [Code Academy Command Line Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) (Tutorial - 45 min)

# Atom or Sublime Text 3

All code is written in software programs called **Code Editors**. At Make School, we require students to code in the [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) code editors.

Please download one or both of these editors and familiarize yourself with their keyboard shortcuts.

# Getting Started with Git & GitHub

You probably have a GitHub account by now, but if you don't please, create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and complete your profile (name, photo, etc). 

## Why Use Git?
In short, developers use git to collaborate on a project simultaneously and save snapshots of different versions of the project.

Watch this 38 min video by Brian Yu where he explains the value of using git and demonstrates how to use it.
