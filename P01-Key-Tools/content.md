At Make School we use a few digital tools to facilitate coding and collaborating with instructors and other students. Each of these tools you will use EVERYDAY when you are at the product college so it is important that they are loaded on your computer and you are familiar with them before you arrive.

# The Command Line or Terminal

If you are not extremely comfortable navigating the command line (also called your computer's "terminal"), please complete the [Code Academy Command Line Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) (Tutorial - 45 min)

# Atom or Sublime Text 3

All code is written in software programs called **Code Editors**. At Make School, we require students to code in the [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) code editors.

Please download one or both of these editors.
