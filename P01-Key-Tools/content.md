At Make School we use a few digital tools to facilitate coding and collaborating with instructors and other students. Each of these tools you will use EVERYDAY when you are at the product college so it is important that they are loaded on your computer and you are familiar with them before you arrive.

# The Command Line or Terminal

If you are not extremely comfortable navigating the command line (also called your computer's "terminal"), please complete the [Code Academy Command Line Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) (Tutorial - 45 min)

# Create A GitHub Account

Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account (if you don't have one yet) and complete your profile (name, photo, etc).

# Git

Complete [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) (1 hour) to learn the basics of Git version control with a guided tutorial.

# Git (more info)

For more information, check out [Learn Version Control with Git](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/) videos and tutorials. You don't need to finish this, watching [videos 1-8](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/videos#episodes) and/or reading [part 1 of the tutorial](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/introduction) is enough for now.

# Atom or Sublime Text 3

All code is written in software programs called **Code Editors**. At Make School, we require students to code in the [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) code editors.

Please download one or both of these editors.

# Google Calendar

Google Calendar is arguably the most important tool you will use at the Product College and in your professional work. You will use it to see your classes, plan meetings with instructors and colleagues, make plans with mentors, find out about events, and much more.

1. Watch this [2017 Google Calendar Tutorial] Video (13 min) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZhvowwdSVI) and be sure you can do the following competencies:
  1. Create events
