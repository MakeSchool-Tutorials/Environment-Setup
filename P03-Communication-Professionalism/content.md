Being productive and organized is going to drive your technical success as an engineer, but you'll also need to level up your professionalism and communication skills to really help you shine in your future career.

# Professionalism

Being professional does not come naturally. Professionalism is a set of behaviors that we all need to work on and train. We can break down professionalism into a few parts:

* **"Over" communicating** - communicating often and effectively with everyone you work with helps aleviate potential confusion and anxiety from not having enough information about a situation
* **Timeliness** - being on time to meetings and completing tasks demonstrates respect for others and their time
* **Speaking and Writing** - avoiding swearing, interrupting, and forms of communication that are out of sync with your environment with help to avoid social missteps
* **Attire** - wearing clean clothes that match the situation you are in

 At Make School you'll have the opportunity to hone your professionalism and communication skills to a high level, but these short videos quickly cover the basics:

# Communication

As stated above, the purpose of communication in a professional setting is to share information effectively and give those around peace of mind that they are as up to date on things as possible. It is always better to be a little redundant than to not give enough updates.

Here are our recommended guidelines for effective communication across different mediums:

* *Email:* Respond to all emails within 36 hours with some response, even if it is just "I'll get back to you on Friday."
* *Slack:* Respond to all Slack messages same day, even if it is just "I'll get back to you on Friday." Here's a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGjsYf48Om4) about Slack if you are not familiar with the tool yet.
* *Text Messages:* Use texts when you need to coordinate same-day with anyone, e.g. if you are going to be late to a meeting. Otherwise use Slack or email.
* *Phone Call:* Use a phone call in the cases of emergency or if a topic is too complex for text or email. If time allows, it's courteous to send a quick text or email first to ask if the other person is free for a call.
