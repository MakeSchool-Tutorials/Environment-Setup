All Make School students learn how to build web servers, even folks who focus on mobile or who want to become data engineers. Why? Because almost every project that is connected to the internet in anyway must have a web server, if only a small one.

# The Request Response Cycle

# RESTful API - Video

A RESTful API means a backend server that can serve up data to clients (like mobile apps and websites) that ask. To get a better idea of what a RESTful API is, watch this brief video that shows how to build one in only 5 minutes.

# Resourceful Routes

Read, understand, and memorize the table of [RESTful & Resourceful Routes](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v2.3/routing.html#restful-routing-the-rails-default) - (This is Ruby on Rails documentation, but the convention applies to the entire web.)


# JSON

Data, data, data, everyone is so hot on data these days. Well how does data move around from say a server to your phone, or between your web browser and a service like Google or Airbnb or Uber? The answer is usually JSON - JavaScript Object Notation.

JSON is made up of **Key Value Pairs** and looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "Bob",
  "age": 24,
  "pets": [
    {
      "name": "Pooch",
      "species": "Dog"
    }
  ]
}
```

To familiarize yourself more with JSON, please watch this great video on JSON called **JSON Crash Course** (30 min).
