## Recommendations

We recommend the following extensions to get you started:

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) - This will allow you to easily write Python in VS Code! auto-completion, debugging, formatting, and more will all be supported. **Without this, you're going to have a hard time, so make sure to install this one!**
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) - launches a local development server with a live reload feature so you can instantly see your changes in a browser!
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - code formatter to make your code look nice and easy to read, following standard styling conventions
- [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) - allows you to easily debug your JavaScript code running in Google Chrome from your VS Code editor!

> Install the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extension for your editor, and take some time to explore other extensions as well! Don't go too crazy though, keep it simple for now! You can always add more later.


# Linting

**Linting** highlights syntactical and stylistic problems in your code, which will help you identify and correct subtle programming errors that you may otherwise miss, or unconventional coding practices that can lead to errors. It's used by software engineers daily, and you should be using it too! It will save you lots of time spending hours trying to find the source of a bug, only to realize you missed an indent somewhere.

# Stretch Challenge: Debugging and Testing

You don't need to set these up right now, but if you're looking to get more familiar with some additional features in VS Code, read on!

> [challenge]
>
> 1. You can use the VS Code debugger to debug your Python code. [Follow their guide here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging) to learn how.
> 1. Knowing how to properly test your code is incredibly important for any software engineer! You'll learn how to do this in our courses, but if you want to have VS Code set up to assist you in your testing process, [follow their testing guide for Python here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing).
