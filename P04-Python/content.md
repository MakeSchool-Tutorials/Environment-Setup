Through our research and collaboration with our industry partners, Make School has decided to focus on these core languages.

* **Python** - For computer science, data science, and whiteboard coding.
* **JavaScript** - For backend and front end web development
* **Swift** - For mobile iOS development

We use Python for our computer science courses because of its beautiful and elegant syntax, its wide-spread use across finance, data science, and web development, and because of its classical, object-oriented structure. You've already gotten a taste of JavaScript from RAMP (or a different language if you passed out of RAMP), so we wanted to introduce Python before you begin using it in Term 1.

# Try Python

We won't dive too deep into Python, as you'll get a lot more practice with it once you arrive! For now, let's just make sure you understand the syntax, and how to write in Python:

# Coding Best Practices

As a Make School student, we expect you to learn and utilize coding best practices. You will learn many more this coming term, but here are a few to set you on the path:

1. **Break down problems into smaller ones** - When you're starting a coding project, it's best to break down the problem into simple steps before jumping right into the code. Consider the goal of the project, then describe (in sentences, not code) the functions you'll need to achieve the goal. Once you have an idea of _what_ to build and what _inputs and outputs_ look like, now you can begin to actually implement the code.
1. **Test as you code** - Test and return/print values within your functions as you build them before moving on to the next one. This will ensure that the baseline of your code works and will prevent you from passing down errors into other functions. Youâ€™ll also get the joy of feeling the code work bit by bit instead of the frustration of trying to debug a massive code beast.
1. **Get Feedback** - More on this next chapter, but you should always seek out feedback on your projects via peers, office hours, coaching, code reviews, etc. You can (and should) get feedback before you even start coding! Ask for feedback on your strategy, or outline of what you plan on building. That way you don't waste time building something that doesn't actually solve the problem.

> Go back to a previous project you built, or one you're currently working on, and apply this problem-solving method to it. How does it work for you?
>
> Don't have a previous project? Totally fine! Apply it to a problem you're having in life! Replace functions with actions to do, and replace comments/implementation with steps to accomplish that action!


# Optional Resources/Challenges

At Make School, we're constantly encouraging our students to dive deeper into the material. We know you can push yourself to learn more, and the prework is no exception to that. Take a look at the sections below, and pick one to jump in to.

## More Python Practice

Complete tutorials 2-8 in Codecademy's [Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python/) tutorial.

## Intro to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming is a common and useful **coding paradigm**, one way to organize code and code's functionality.

Watch these 6 videos for [Python OOP Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM&list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc) by Corey Schafer. (Approx. 1 hour)

Pay attention to the following words and how they are used:

* Class
* Instance
* Assignment
* Method
* Class Variables
* Static Method
* Class Methods
* Instance method
* Inheritance
* `self`
* `print()`


## More OOP

The following tutorial provides more examples of working with OOP that can serve as a useful text-based reference of the concepts that you can refer back to:

* [An Introduction to Classes and Inheritance](http://www.jesshamrick.com/2011/05/18/an-introduction-to-classes-and-inheritance-in-python/) by Jess Hamrick

## OOP Practice

Return to the Codecademy [Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) tutorial and complete the two interactive lessons in section 11 "Introduction to Classes".

Once you've completed the lessons, can you answer the following questions:

* What is a 'class'? What is an example of a class besides the examples you have already seen?
* How are classes used in OOP?
* What is 'inheritance'? What is an example of inheritance?
