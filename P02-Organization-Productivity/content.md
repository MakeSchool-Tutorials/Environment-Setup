At Make School you will learn to be multiple times more productive than you have ever been. This increase in productivity is a superpower that will make you successful at Make School and in your future success as a software engineer.

We've broken down productivity into three parts:

* Staying Organized
* Removing Distractions
* Taking Action

# Organized Priorities

It won't matter how well you have things organized if they are the wrong things!

Check out this LifeHacker article, [Productivity 101: A Primer to the Getting Things Done (GTD) Philosophy](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-getting-things-done-1551880955) for a quick overview of the popular GTD method. (If you'd like to read the full book but can not access it, there are copies available to read at Make School.)

As the GTD method acknowledges, there are countless ways to track todos, but unless you want to go insane, you need to **pick just one**.

Each person likes something different. Some just use a note in the Apple Notes app. Other people use [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com/), [Trello](http://trello.com) or [Asana](http://asana.com). Others just use a day planner or legal pad.

They key is to create a **Single Source of Truth** list: one source to hold all of your tasks. Otherwise, you’ll have multiple lists, double count tasks, lose track of what you put where, or scratch one thing off a list only to find it somewhere else.

To codify your types of work, productivity guru David Allen recommends categorizing your to-dos into four sections:

1. *Projects* - current work + action items
2. *Waiting On* - things you’re waiting on from other people
3. *Someday/Maybe* - dreams, possible projects
4. *Collection* - where you deposit new ideas and tasks

Pick and setup one source of truth now and move all your todos to it.

# Organized Computer

It is important to have an organized computer and file structure so you can find things quickly that you want to work on or reference.

Take time now to delete extra programs and files to free up space, and organize your desktop and browser.

Create one folder in the root of your computer called `dev`  or `code` and put all projects you ever do inside this folder. This will prevent your code being strewn all over your computer.

Try doing this in the Terminal:

```
bash
$ cd ~

$ mkdir dev // create a folder called "dev"

$ cd dev // change directory to "dev"

$ mkdir new_coding_project // create a new coding project folder (replace new_coding_project with your project name)
```

# Organized Calendar

Google Calendar is arguably the most important tool you will use at the Product College and in your professional work. You will use it to see your classes, plan meetings with instructors and colleagues, make plans with mentors, find out about events, and much more.

Watch the below Google Calendar Tutorial video (13 min) and be sure you can do the following:

  1. Create events
  2. Invite guests to events
  3. Allow guests to modify events
  4. View another calendar
  5. Block off time to work

# Removing Distractions

All the software on our phones and the internet are built to make you addicted to it. News, social media, emails, slacks, texts, snaps, etc. are all distractions that eat up the vital time you need to practice the craft of coding.

In order to be productive we have to remove all distractions and actively focus on coding projects. Here are some things that you should immediately begin adding to your routine.

* Silencing your phone entirely
* Turn off all notifications on your computer including slack and email.
* Follow a "Maker Schedule" and plan to code the first 3-4 hours of each day without checking email or slack.
* Schedule "Time Blocks" other times during the week where you only code.
* Put away your phone while working. Studies show that [a mere presence of your smartphone](https://news.utexas.edu/2017/06/26/the-mere-presence-of-your-smartphone-reduces-brain-power) can decrease cognitive functioning.
* Wear earphones when working.
* Download [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) to literally block distracting sites.

# Taking Action

This is the "Engage" part of the GTD process. If you've eliminated as many potential distractions as possible in the previous steps, then all you need to do now is focus on the task at hand. (Sounds easy, but we know it isn't!)

One good method to aid you in keeping focused is using Time Blocks (or [timeboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing)). Another variation of this, called the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), involves using a timer to focus your time into alternating work blocks and short breaks.

## During a Work Block

While you are in a time block you do not check email or Slack or the news or Facebook, nothing. Instead you check your plan or todo list.

* Make a plan - always plan what you will do step-by-step
* Work off the plan - follow the plan you made
* Update the plan - as you learn more update your plan

## The Rest of the Time

When you are not in a time block, you might be checking email, slack, and otherwise puttering around. This is OK, but you also have to keep your wits about you and track what you need to do in the future. So follow these steps:

* If a task is 2 minutes - just do it
* If a task is a fixed amount of time - schedule it on your calendar
* If a task will take an indeterminate amount of time - put it on your single source of truth.

# Optional Resources

The following document and worksheet cover the same topics as the above sections, but with some more information about other varieties of organization and productivity methods. Again, you don't have to follow the exact methods listed, as long as you are picking a method and mastering it to help you improve your productivity.
