This section is mandatory prework if you are seeking to concentrate on web development, but optional otherwise.

In order to begin at Make School in the web development track, you must be familiar with the most basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Intro to HTML & CSS

HTML might seems simple, but using it well can be somewhat challenging. The following playlist of videos on youtube that will explain the concept of **Semantic HTML**. This concept will be featured on the diagnostic assessment during orientation.

CSS is a powerful and flexible styling syntax. Whether you think it is God's gift to humans or just cake decorating, it is important for all web developers to have a solid mastery of simple CSS concepts and tools.

# Intro to Dev Tools

Probably the least celebrated, but most used, web development tool is the browser itself. And not just the browser but the browser's **Dev Tools** pane. We use this pane of tools to debug, scale, and tweak the websites we build.

The following playlist covers the basics of working with the Chrome Developer Tools (dev tools in other browsers are often very similar):

# JavaScript

Make School's web track focuses primarily on JavaScript on both the front and the backend.

# jQuery

jQuery is still an incredibly popular client-side library for JavaScript. jQuery wraps some complex JavaScript code into simpler commands. Web developers use it to manipulate and change the DOM, to make animations, and to make HTTP requests to servers using AJAX.

Let's use [Giphy's API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/) to make our own gif search engine.

This tutorial project brings together and extends the introductary work covered above.

We'll be looking at your completed version of this project on the first day of class.
