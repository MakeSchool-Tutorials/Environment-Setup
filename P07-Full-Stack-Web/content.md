This section is mandatory prework if you are seeking to concentrate on web development, but optional otherwise.

In order to begin at Make School in the web development track, you must be familiar with the most basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Intro to HTML

HTML might seems simple, but using it well can be somewhat challenging. The following playlist of videos on youtube will explain the concept of **Semantic HTML**. This concept will be featured on the diagnostic assessment during orientation.

* Please watch the following playlist that explains [HTML semantics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcZ_dx1rf5U&list=PLWjCJDeWfDdc0Sp_DinOWnodw3KnWCwc1)

# Intro to CSS

CSS is a powerful and flexible styling syntax. Whether you think it is God's gift to humans or just cake decorating, it is important for all web developers to have a solid mastery of simple CSS concepts and tools. Please watch the following video:

## Extra

You can use Emmet to write HTML and CSS extra fast in Sublime or Atom.

* Optionally, learn more about [Emmet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQurqKG6nGY)

# Intro to Dev Tools

Probably the least celebrated, but most used, web development tool is the browser itself, and more specifically, the browser's **Dev Tools** pane. We use this pane of tools to debug, scale, and tweak the websites we build.

The following playlist covers the basics of working with the Chrome Developer Tools (dev tools in other browsers, like Safari, are often very similar):

* Please watch [Using Chrome Developer Tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV9PLPFTnkE&list=PLfdtiltiRHWEQ6wtGVC57qrlRtQPyylya)

# JavaScript

Make School's web track focuses primarily on JavaScript for both frontend development and backend development.

* Please complete [Codecademy's Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

As a reminder, Codecademy uses a freemium model. There are free sections and paid sections. You only need to complete the free sections.

## Extra

* [Code Wars: JavaScript](https://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript)

# jQuery

jQuery is still an incredibly popular client-side library for JavaScript. jQuery wraps some complex JavaScript code into simpler commands. Web developers use it to manipulate and change the DOM (Document Object Model), to make animations, and to make HTTP requests to servers using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML).

Let's use [Giphy's API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/) to make our own gif search engine.

This tutorial project brings together and extends the introductory work covered above.

* Please complete [Make School's "Giphy Search" Tutorial](https://www.makeschool.com/online-courses/tutorials/giphy-search-app-with-node-js/your-node-environment)
