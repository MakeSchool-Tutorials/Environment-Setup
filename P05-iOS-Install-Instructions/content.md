You should update and install your iOS development environment before the Python one, as the Python installers actually have some dependencies on the iOS tools.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Some sections here apply to all students, some only apply to students going on a Mobile track. Please make sure to read the section headers. Note that you can always come back here and install the necessary tools should you decide to be a mobile student later on.

# Command Line Tools (ALL STUDENTS)

Install the Xcode Command Line Tools, which is a bundle of command-line based software for developers. It includes things like `git`, `gcc` and `clang`. For a complete list, see [this article](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/).

> [action]
>
> Install Command Line Tools by running this command in terminal:
>
```bash
$ xcode-select --install
```

# Download Xcode (ONLY MOBILE STUDENTS)

To install the latest version of Xcode, you need the latest version of Mac OS before you install Xcode.

> [action]
>
> 1. On the upper left corner, click the apple icon, and click `About This Mac`
> 1. From the `Overview` tab, click on `Software Update`, and if there are any updates available, install them.

From here, Xcode is an easy download in the Mac App Store:

> [action]
>
> Open the App Store on your laptop and search for `Xcode`. From there, install it!

After it's installed (this will take some time, it's not a quick download), you should open Xcode to allow it to do some additional installation and configuration. Note that you should **not install a beta version of Xcode!** Only install a production version through the app store.
