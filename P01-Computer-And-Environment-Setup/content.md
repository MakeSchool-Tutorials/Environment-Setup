> Why do we require your laptop to be from _Apple_? We have found that it is difficult to support the tools/languages we use in our fast-paced learning environment on a PC. Whether it's web, mobile, or data science, a Mac (OSX) environment is much easier to work with both for the students and the instructor, and also goes far to helping guarantee a students success by minimizing hardware issues.

Unfortunately, we cannot offer any sort of exceptions to this policy, students in the past who we have allowed to use workarounds such as a "hackintosh" or virtual machines have not been successful. If you cannot meet these requirements, please review the [Laptop section of our student handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1i2jwXqx__URpWvUf8z8E9iwcdJ05QsPnbjs7Z83Us/preview#heading=h.p5a6appfat36) for available options on how to find an economical laptop that meets these requirements.

If you have any questions about the laptop requirements, please message [questions@makeschool.com](mailto:questions@makeschool.com).

# Operating System

Next you must download and install - or update - your operating system. The operating system is the software that allows your whole computer to function. This step is important so that we're all starting off with the same operating system version, as there are minor differences between them.
