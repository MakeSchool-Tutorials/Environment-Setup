## Computer Requirements

In order to participate in Make School, you must have a laptop that meets the the following requirements:

1. An Apple Laptop
1. At least 8 MB of Random Access Memory (RAM)
1. At least 100 GB of Solid State Drive (SSD) Storage
1. A battery that holds a charge
1. A fully-functioning keyboard
1. A fully-functioning screen

> Why do we require your laptop to be from _Apple_? We have found that it is difficult to support the tools/languages we use in our fast-paced learning environment on a PC. Whether it's web, mobile, or data science, a Mac (OSX) environment is much easier to work with both for the students and the instructor, and also goes far to helping guarantee a students success by minimizing hardware issues.

Unfortunately, we cannot offer any sort of exceptions to this policy, students in the past who we have allowed to use workarounds such as a "hackintosh" or virtual machines have not been successful. If you cannot meet these requirements, please review the [Laptop section of our student handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1i2jwXqx__URpWvUf8z8E9iwcdJ05QsPnbjs7Z83Us/preview#heading=h.p5a6appfat36) for available options on how to find an economical laptop that meets these requirements.

# Stretch Challenge: The Command Line or Terminal

## Note About Stretch Challenges

You'll frequently see Stretch Challenges throughout your time at Make School. These challenges are _optional_, and are there to help give you more practice, or to dive deeper into a topic. If you want to go the extra mile and enhance your learning, we encourage you to complete them after you have completed the required content for a chapter/project/lesson/etc.

## The Command Line or Terminal

As a software engineer, the command line will be your best friend! It allows you to more directly interact with your computer.

We'll be covering the terminal in more depth over the course of our Term 1 curriculum, but if you're ready to dive in now, here are some resources to start learning how to navigate your terminal:

> Any time you see a green box like this with a trophy, it will indicate an _optional challenge_.
>
> Complete the **Chapters 1-2** of [Code Academy Command Line Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)
>
> This tutorial will familiarize you with the following commands:
>
> `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `mv`, `rm`, `cp`
>
> If you're looking to further your terminal knowledge even more, finish the remaining 3 chapters in the Code Academy tutorial.
