Through our research and collaboration with our industry partners, Make School has decided to focus on four core languages.

* **Python** - For computer science, data science, and whiteboard coding.
* **JavaScript** - For backend and front end web development
* **Swift** - For mobile iOS development

We use Python for our computer science courses because of its beautiful and elegant syntax, its wide-spread use across finance, data science, and web development, and because of its classical, object-oriented structure. You've already gotten a taste of JavaScript from RAMP (or a different language if you passed out of RAMP), so we wanted to introduce Python before you begin using it in Term 1.

# Try Python

We won't dive too deep into Python, as you'll get a lot more practice with it once you arrive! For now, let's just make sure you understand the syntax, and how to write in Python:

# Optional Resources/Challenges

## More Python Practice

Complete tutorials 2-8 in Codecademy's [Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python/) tutorial.

## Intro to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming is a common and useful **coding paradigm**, one way to organize code and code's functionality.

Watch these 6 videos for [Python OOP Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM&list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc) by Corey Schafer. (Approx. 1 hour)

Pay attention to the following words and how they are used:

* Class
* Instance
* Assignment
* Method
* Class Variables
* Static Method
* Class Methods
* Instance method
* Inheritance
* `self`
* `print()`


## Other Resources

The following tutorial provides more examples of working with OOP that can serve as a useful text-based reference of the concepts that you can refer back to:

* [An Introduction to Classes and Inheritance](http://www.jesshamrick.com/2011/05/18/an-introduction-to-classes-and-inheritance-in-python/) by Jess Hamrick

## OOP Practice

Return to the Codecademy [Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) tutorial and complete the two interactive lessons in section 11 "Introduction to Classes".

Once you've completed the lessons, can you answer the following questions:

* What is a 'class'? What is an example of a class besides the examples you have already seen?
* How are classes used in OOP?
* What is 'inheritance'? What is an example of inheritance?
