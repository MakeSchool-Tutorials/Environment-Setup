# Break down problem-solving into smaller steps
students get overwhelmed by big projects when they think about solving it all at once. The best coders, instead, break down their project planning into phases, starting at the high level and progressing into more and more detail.

This phase by phase approach makes the project more approachable.


## Phase 1: Conceptual

what is the outcome of the project. “Final project should be able to xyz”

## Phase 2: Functions

 write each function and comment on what the code must carry out.

## Phase 3: Function inputs & outputs

comment on what arguments are passed in and returned from functions?

## Phase 4: First function

code and test it

## Phase 5-N: Code and test

Second function, code and test it. Third function, code and test. Forth function, code and test … etc.

# Get feedback

 on steps and strategy before starting each phase.


# Test as you code

Don’t code the whole project and then run it. You’ll face a ton of errors and will have difficulty debugging. Instead, test and return/print values within your FIRST function before you move on to the second. This will ensure that the baseline of your code works and will prevent you from passing down errors into other functions. You’ll also get the joy of feeling the code work bit by bit instead of the frustration of trying to debug a massive code beast.
