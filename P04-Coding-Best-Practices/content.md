Ok, not quite coding just yet, but there will be _plenty_ of time for that. Before we dive right in, we wanted to share a few quick practices to follow now that you're going to be coding full time in the very near future. These guidelines will help you regardless of what class you're taking, or what language you're programming in. If you're stuck, or faced with a seemingly insurmountable problem, first you should take a deep breath. Once you've done that, remember these key ideas:

# Break down problem-solving into smaller steps
Many students get overwhelmed by big projects when they think about solving it all at once. However, the best coders break down their project planning into _phases_, starting at the high level and progressing into more and more detail.

This phase by phase approach makes the project more approachable. Let's go over and get familiar with them:

- **Phase 1: Conceptual** - what is the outcome of the project? i.e. “My final project should be able to xyz”
- **Phase 2: Functions** - write each function name and comment on what the code must carry out. Note that we're _not_ implementing the functions, we just want to describe what they're going to do when we implement them.
- **Phase 3: Function inputs & outputs** - in each function stub, comment on what arguments are passed in and returned from the function
- **Phase 4: First function** - now pick one function to implement, following what you had written previously in the comments. Make sure to test this function as well!
- **Phase 5-N: Code and test** - repeat step 4 for the rest of the functions!

> Go back to a previous project you built, or one you're currently working on, and apply this problem-solving method to it. How does it work for you?
>
> Don't have a previous project? Totally fine! Apply it to a problem you're having in life! Replace functions with actions to do, and replace comments/implementation with steps to accomplish that action!

# Get feedback

 When was the last time you looked at an essay you wrote, thought everything was phenominal, and then a peer or teacher read it and had numerous points of improvement? The same principle applies to coding! We work on something for so long we don't have fresh eyes anymore, so we're more likely to miss mistakes.

 Always seek out feedback on your projects via peers, office hours, coaching, code reviews, etc. You can (and should) get feedback before you even start coding! Ask for feedback on your strategy, or outline of what you plan on building. That way you don't waste time building something that doesn't actually solve the problem.

 > On the first day of class, take note of the listed office hours. Make it a point to go to at least one per class to get feedback on whatever you're working on!

# Test as you code

Don’t code the whole project and then run it. You’ll face a ton of errors and will have difficulty debugging. Instead, test and return/print values within your **first** function before you move on to the next. This will ensure that the baseline of your code works and will prevent you from passing down errors into other functions. You’ll also get the joy of feeling the code work bit by bit instead of the frustration of trying to debug a massive code beast.

Alright, _now_ let's actually get back to coding!
