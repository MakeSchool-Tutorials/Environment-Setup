Like any college, Make School has a large number of policies that we expect all students to adhere to. These policies will be covered more in depth during your orientation, but we want to give you a brief overview of a few of them.

# Grading System

Make School uses a pass/fail grading system for all courses. We utilize rubrics and other assessment tools to track a student's mastery of a course. In order to pass a course, you must complete all assignments as indicated by your instructor, as well as pass all assessments in the course. This can include, but is not limited to, quizzes, exams, projects, homework, and self-evaluations.
