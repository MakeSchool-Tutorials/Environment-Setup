Being productive and organized is going to drive your success at Make School and as an engineer. Not communicating properly and being unprofessional are going to hinder your success. So we made this brief need-to-know guide for what to do and not do.

# Professionalism

Being professional does not come naturally. Professionalism is a set of behaviors that we all need to work on and train. We can break down professionalism into a few parts:

* **Overcommunicating** - communicating more than what feels necessary with everyone you work with.
* **Timeliness** - being on time to meetings and completing tasks
* **Speaking and Writing** - avoiding swearing, interrupting, and forms of communication that are out of sync with your environment.
* **Attire** - wearing clean clothes that match the situation you are in

These 2 videos are kind of ridiculous, but both have good rules of thumb for how to be professional. If you find a better video or videos on being professional please share! :D

# Communication

Here are the guidelines:

## Email
* Respond to all emails within 36 hours with some response, even if it is just "I'll get back to you on Friday".

## Slack
* Respond to all slacks same day, even if it is just "I'll get back to you on Friday". Here's a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGjsYf48Om4) about slack if you are not familiar with the tool.

## Text
* Use texts when you need to coordinate same-day with anyone, e.g. if you are going to be late to a meeting. Otherwise use slack or email.

## Phone Call
* Use a phone call in the cases of emergency or if a topic is too complex for text or email.
