In this course, we will cover critical competencies and requirements for you to begin learning at Make School's Product College. We will link to internal and external tutorials, videos, and articles. Please complete these resources before clicking the "Mark as Complete" checkbox.

Weâ€™ve cut things down to the pure essentials to save time. Think of this course as a list of materials you should understand with our suggestions on how to learn it. You do not need to complete materials that cover concepts you have already mastered. However, keep in mind that you will be assessed on these concepts during the first week at the Product College and if you are not ready, you will be required to complete these materials before beginning any other work. 

We'll cover:

1. Computer Requirements & Setup
2. Introduction to Key Tools
3. Python & Object Oriented Programming
4. Organization & Productivity
5. Communication & Professionalism
6. Code of Conduct & Academic and Professional Integrity
7. RESTful API & Web Server Architecture (required for everyone)
8. Full Stack Web (required for web concentrations)
9. Mobile iOS (for iOS concentrations)

# Computer Requirements & Setup

In order to participate in the Product College, you must have an Apple laptop (MacBook) that has the following:

1. Solid State hard drive
2. At least 8G of Memory (RAM)
3. A battery that holds a charge
4. A 100% working screen, keyboard, and trackpad

If you do not have these here you have two options.

1. Purchase a new, used, or refurbished laptop with these requirements.
2. Upgrade your current under-powered MacBook with a solid state drive and/or more RAM. See tutorials on [How to add a solid state drive](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/upgrade-your-macbook-install-ssd-hard-drive/) and [How to add more RAM](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201165)

It is required for you to have your computer meeting these requirements BEFORE arriving at Make School.

Unfortunately, we cannot offer any sort of exceptions to this policy, students in the past who we have allowed to use workarounds such as a "hackintosh" or virtual machines have not been successful.

# Operating System and Xcode

Finally, you must download and install - or update - two (free) major pieces of software, your operating system and Xcode. 

1. Updated your MacBook's operating system (OSX) to the [most recent stable version of the Apple operating system](https://www.apple.com/macos/how-to-upgrade/).
2. Downloaded the most recent version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
