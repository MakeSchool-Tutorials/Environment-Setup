In this tutorial we will cover critical competencies and requirements for you to begin learning at the Product College at Make School. We will link to internal and external tutorials, videos, and articles. Please complete these resources before marking those sections as "Mark Complete".

It is not necessary to complete materials for concepts and competencies you have already mastered, but you will be assessed during orientation for these competencies and if you are not ready, you will be required to complete these competencies before beginning any other work.

We'll cover:

1. Computer Requirements & Setup
2. Critical Software and Tools
3. Python & Object Oriented Programming
5. Professionalism
5. RESTful API & Web Server Architecture (for everyone)
4. Full Stack Web (for web concentrations)
5. Mobile iOS (for iOS concentrations)

# Computer Requirements & Setup

In order to participate in the Product College, you must have an Apple laptop that has the following:

1. Solid State hard drive
1. At least 8G of Memory (RAM)
1. A battery that holds a charge
1. A 100% working screen, keyboard, and trackpad

If you do not have these here you have two options.

1. Purchase a new, used, or refurbished laptop with these requirements.
1. Upgrade your current under-powered laptop with a solid state drive and/or more RAM. [How to add a solid state drive](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/upgrade-your-macbook-install-ssd-hard-drive/), [How to add more RAM](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201165)

It is required for you to have your computer meeting these requirements BEFORE arriving at Make School.

Unfortunately, we cannot offer any sort of exceptions to this policy, students in the past who we have allowed to use workarounds such as a "hackintosh" or virtual machines have not succeeded and have only damaged their own progress.

# Operating System and Xcode

For your computer to be ready to code, you must have two major pieces of software up to date, your operating system and Xcode.

1. Updated your operating system to the most recent stable version of the Apple operating system.
1. Downloaded the most recent version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

Please complete these now before continuing. These downloads and updates might take multiple hours.
