Weâ€™ve cut things down to the pure essentials to save time. Think of this course as a list of materials you should understand with our suggestions on how to learn it. You do not need to complete materials that cover concepts you have already mastered. However, keep in mind that you will be assessed on these concepts during the first week at the Product College and if you are not ready, you will be required to complete these materials before beginning any other work.
