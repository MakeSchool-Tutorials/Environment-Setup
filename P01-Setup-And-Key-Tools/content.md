## Computer Requirements

In order to participate in Make School, you must have a laptop that meets the the following requirements:

1. An Apple Laptop
1. At least 8 MB of Random Access Memory (RAM)
1. At least 100 GB of Solid State Drive (SSD) Storage
1. A battery that holds a charge
1. A fully-functioning keyboard
1. A fully-functioning screen

If you do not have these, please review the [Laptop section of our student handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18K7ue1L0lVw96nsaflLGLBUcfefsb0RYxVIv1xm0o30/preview#heading=h.s8dsu973nbr) for available options on how to find an economical laptop that meets these requirements.

> Why do we require your laptop to be from _Apple_? We have found that it is difficult to support the tools/languages we use in our fast-paced learning environment on a PC. Whether it's web, mobile, or data science, a Mac (OSX) environment is much easier to work with both for the students and the instructor, and also goes far to helping guarantee a students success by minimizing hardware issues.

It is required for you to have your computer meeting these requirements BEFORE arriving at Make School.

Unfortunately, we cannot offer any sort of exceptions to this policy, students in the past who we have allowed to use workarounds such as a "hackintosh" or virtual machines have not been successful.

> Ensure that your computer meets these requirements, or that you have a plan in place to obtain a computer that does meet these requirements before continuing through the remainder of this chapter.

# Operating System

Next you must download and install - or update - your operating system:

> Update your MacBook's operating system (OSX) to the [most recent stable version of the Apple operating system](https://www.apple.com/macos/how-to-upgrade/)

This download may take multiple hours to complete, so please start it now before continuing.


# Key Tools

At Make School we use a few digital tools to facilitate coding and collaborating with instructors and other students. You will use these tools EVERY DAY when you are on campus, so it is important that they are loaded on your computer and you are familiar with them before you arrive.

# The Command Line or Terminal

We need to make sure you get your feet wet with navigating the command line (also called your computer's "terminal").

>
> Please complete the **Chapters 1-2** of  [Code Academy Command Line Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)

You should become familiar with all of the following commands before proceeding to the next section:

`ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `mv`, `rm`, `cp`

> [challenge]
>
> Any time you see a green box like this with a trophy, it will indicate an _optional challenge_. If you're looking to further your terminal knowledge even more, finish the remaining 3 chapters in the Code Academy tutorial

NOTE: Codecademy tutorials follow the "freemium" model where parts of the tutorial content are only available to paid users. You only need to complete the free sections.

# Environment Setup

Ok, so now you know how to navigate the terminal, feeling pretty confident in creating folders and files without using Finder. Let's get the rest of your computer set up for success at Make School.

> [action]
>
> Complete the Make School [Environment Setup Tutorial](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/environment-setup-39i) to get all of the tools/software you'll need

This will take a few hours to complete, but we'll be here ready for you when you're all set up and ready to move forward!
