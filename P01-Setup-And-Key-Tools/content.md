## Computer Requirements

In order to participate in the Product College, you must have an Apple laptop (MacBook) that has the following:

1. Solid State hard drive
2. At least 8G of Memory (RAM)
3. A battery that holds a charge
4. A 100% working screen, keyboard, and trackpad

If you do not have these here you have two options.

1. Purchase a new, used, or refurbished laptop with these requirements.
2. Upgrade your current under-powered MacBook with a solid state drive and/or more RAM. See tutorials on [How to add a solid state drive](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/upgrade-your-macbook-install-ssd-hard-drive/) and [How to add more RAM](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201165)

It is required for you to have your computer meeting these requirements BEFORE arriving at Make School.

Unfortunately, we cannot offer any sort of exceptions to this policy, students in the past who we have allowed to use workarounds such as a "hackintosh" or virtual machines have not been successful.

# Operating System and Xcode

Next you must download and install - or update - two (free) major pieces of software, your operating system and Xcode.

1. Updated your MacBook's operating system (OSX) to the [most recent stable version of the Apple operating system](https://www.apple.com/macos/how-to-upgrade/).
2. Downloaded the most recent version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

These downloads may take multiple hours to download, so please start them now before continuing.


# Key Tools

At Make School we use a few digital tools to facilitate coding and collaborating with instructors and other students. You will use these tools EVERY DAY when you are at the Product College so it is important that they are loaded on your computer and you are familiar with them before you arrive.

# The Command Line or Terminal

If you are not already comfortable with navigating the command line (also called your computer's "terminal"), please complete the [Code Academy Command Line Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) (45 - 60 min)

You should become familiar with all of the following commands before proceeding to the next section:

`ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `mv`, `rm`, `cp`, `wildcards`, `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `>`, `<`, `>>`, `|`, `sort`, `uniq`, `grep`, `sed`, `env`, `alias`, and `bash profile`

> [info]
NOTE: Codecademy tutorials follow the "freemium" model where parts of the tutorial content are only available to paid users. You only need to complete the free sections.

# Atom or Sublime Text 3

All code is written in software programs called **Code Editors** or **IDEs** (integrated development environment). At Make School, we require students to code in either [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).

Please download one or both of these editors and familiarize yourself with their keyboard shortcuts.
Sublime:
* [Download](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
* [Mac Shortcuts](https://gist.github.com/paulovera/4486672)

Atom:
* [Mac Download](https://atom.io/download/mac)
* [Mac Shortcuts](https://www.shortcutfoo.com/app/dojos/atom-mac/cheatsheet)

# Git

## Why Use Git?
In short, developers use git to collaborate on a project simultaneously and save snapshots of different versions of the project.

Watch this 5 min video by Paul Programming where he explains the value of using git:

## Create a GitHub Account
If you do not have a Github account yet, please create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and complete your profile (name, photo, etc).

# Practice Git

Now that you have a general understanding of git, practice your skills at [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/). This is a great way to learn and practice the basics of git from the browser with a guided tutorial.

Complete at least the following sections:
* On the "Main" tab, do the Introduction Sequence, parts 1-4
* On the "Remote" tab, do Push and Pull Git Remotes, parts 1-7
* Complete extra sections to level up your git skills even more
